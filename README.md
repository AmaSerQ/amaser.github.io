# amaser.github.io
This is my first attempt at creating a Github Page.
I want to use it to document my own process of learning the front-end, and as for why I used Github Page.
I guess I thought it was clean enough and reliable enough.

Anyway, this is just a test site.
I am still learning JavaScript, and I'll improve this repository as I learn the basics.

If you see this site, please leave your valuable comments!
